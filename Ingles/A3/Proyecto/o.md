Hi everyone. My name is Joel.
Today I show you what I do when I go to a café.
I order a drink and something to eat.
Let’s go!

can i have a coffee and a sandwich, please.
i'd like a small juice too, please?
Thank you.

I usually go to a café in the morning.
I always drink coffee.
Sometimes I eat cake in the afternoon.


Can I have the bill, please?
Here you are.

Thank you very much.
That’s how I order and pay in a café.
Goodbye!
